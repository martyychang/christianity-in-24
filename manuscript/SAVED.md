Q: How do I get into heaven?
A: Jesus saves the faithful. So just be faithful to God.

## Commentary ##

We're all going to die one day. Morbid, perhaps, or just real. Death means our physical bodies are going to fail, our hearts will stop, our neurons will stop firing, and life as we know it will come to an end.

But God promises an afterlife. To be clear, God tells us that your soul will live on, heading toward a final judgment at which point you will be either granted eternal life (entry into heaven) or condemned to eternal death (no heaven for you). The only problem is that standard of conduct required for entry is high, unattainable high. So high, in fact, that you and I have already dropped the ball.

Luckily for us, Jesus came to earth and let himself be horribly tortured, humiliated and nailed to a wooden cross, so that you and I may know that we can be saved on that final day of judgment. When we come up short, Jesus will step in to save us. Not because we deserve it, for we will be saved by grace, not by merit.

Does this mean everyone will be saved? No. By faith you will be saved. Since your salvation hinges on a single word, "faith", the word bears some explanation.

In [the Parable of the Sower][1], Jesus explains the four stages of faith. Below are the stages and a few examples of what people at each stage may say, along with the expected verdict on the final day of judgment.

* **Along the path**. "God is ridiculous. God doesn't exist." Death verdict.
* **On rocky ground**. "God is great. Heaven sounds cool. But I really don't want to hear about these responsibilities." Death verdict.
* **Among thorns**. "God is great. Heaven sounds cool. But these responsibilities are too heavy. My worldly comforts are too good to give up." Death verdict.
* **On good soil**. "God is great. Heaven is real. Though I will stumble and fall, I know all I have is God's, and I gladly accept what I must do." _Life_ verdict.

To figure out whether someone's (including yourself) is on good soil, try a few simple questions.

* Are you saving for retirement? See [Acts 5:1-11][2].
* Do you work in the financial services _industry_ (loans, insurance, securities, etc.)? See [Matthew 21:12-13][3].
* Do you avoid talking honestly about your income and expenses?
* Do you prioritize the _wants_ of yourself and your family (i.e., parents, siblings, spouse, children) first and foremost, putting the _needs_ of your Christian brothers and sisters at a distant second? See [Matthew 12:46-50][4].

Basically, if there's any topic or subject you're not willing to examine as it may reveal a conflict with doing the will of God, you're probably stuck among thorns. And if you're offended by this statement, that's probably further objective proof of where you are in your faith.

I'm sorry if this sounds harsh (it's harsh to me as well, even as I write this), but there's hope for us still. We don't all have to become well known servant leaders like [Mother Teresa][5] or [Mahatma Ghandi][6], but simply _working_ earnestly to change your answers to questions like those above is a great place to start. And for most of us, having a community of believers who share similar struggles but also similar desires to rise above those struggles would go a long way.

Let's talk more about community in another chapter, but as a quick suggestion you could start with the [_Christianity in 24 Hours_ repo on GitHub][7].
