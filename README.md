# Christianity in 24 Hours

This living book (meaning never finished, always being challenged and refined) is modeled after the [Sams Teach Yourself][1] series, with the belief that Christianity is not some extremely difficult subject to understand. In fact, over the course of 24 hours, you can come to have a functionally complete knowledge of Christianity. From there, you can make a very informed decision on whether to embrace Christianity as your faith.

Yes, the Bible—sometimes called the "word of God"—is extremely verbose and at times difficult to understand in today's language. But God's will is actually quite simple, and you should be wary of anyone who tries to tell you otherwise. In fact, Jesus is pretty blunt about God's commandments.

> You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.
— [Matthew 22:37-40 ESV][2]
